# RtD

Built using .NET Core 9 and compiled in Visual Studio 2022 (v17+)

## How to compile?

- Clone the repository.
- Download .NET Framework package for Visual Studio (see Rtd.csproj), or use any other tool of your choise.
- Compile and run the code (later releases might appear).

### Additional info

Project code was written using LLM model. Then i looked throught all of the code myself.
The .exe files in releases (might appear) are a publish version with dependencies built-in, that's why the file size is so large.
